   - Explain how `synchronized` works and provide examples of its usage.

4. **What is a race condition?**
   - Define race conditions and discuss how they can occur in multi-threaded applications.

5. **What are the different states of a thread in Java?**
   - Describe the lifecycle of a thread, including various states like new, runnable, blocked, waiting, timed waiting, and terminated.

### Intermediate Level

1. **What is a deadlock, and how can you prevent it?**
   - Explain deadlocks with examples and discuss strategies to prevent them.

2. **What is the difference between `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` methods in Java?**
   - Describe their purposes and how they are used in thread synchronization.

3. **What are the differences between `synchronized` method and `synchronized` block?**
   - Discuss when to use each and their implications on performance.

4. **What is a thread pool, and why is it used?**
   - Explain the concept of thread pools and how `ExecutorService` helps in managing a pool of threads.

5. **What is the `volatile` keyword in Java?**
   - Describe the purpose of `volatile` and how it affects visibility and ordering of variables.

### Advanced Level

1. **Explain the concept of the Java Memory Model (JMM).**
   - Discuss the JMM and its role in defining how threads interact through memory.

2. **What are `CountDownLatch` and `CyclicBarrier`?**
   - Explain their differences and use cases with examples.

3. **What is the `ReentrantLock` class, and how does it differ from `synchronized`?**
   - Discuss features of `ReentrantLock` and when it is preferable over `synchronized`.

4. **What is a `Future` in Java, and how do you use it?**
   - Describe the `Future` interface and provide examples of its usage in concurrent programming.

5. **How does the `ForkJoinPool` work?**
   - Explain the `ForkJoinPool` and the concepts of work-stealing and parallelism it uses.

### Practical/Hands-On Questions

1. **Write a Java program that demonstrates a producer-consumer problem using a blocking queue.**
   - Provide a sample implementation using `ArrayBlockingQueue` or `LinkedBlockingQueue`.

2. **Implement a thread-safe singleton class in Java.**
   - Provide an implementation using `synchronized` and another using `Bill Pugh Singleton Design`.

3. **Write a Java program to solve the dining philosophers problem.**
   - Provide an example that avoids deadlock using appropriate synchronization techniques.

4. **Implement a simple thread pool from scratch in Java.**
   - Discuss the basic structure and provide a sample implementation.

5. **Write a Java program to calculate the sum of an array using multiple threads.**
   - Divide the array into segments and sum them up in parallel, then combine the results.

### Conceptual Questions

1. **What is the difference between concurrency and parallelism?**
   - Discuss the concepts and provide examples of each.

2. **How does `ConcurrentHashMap` work internally?**
   - Explain the internal structure and mechanisms that make `ConcurrentHashMap` thread-safe.

3. **What are `ThreadLocal` variables, and how are they used?**
   - Describe the purpose of `ThreadLocal` and provide examples of its usage.

4. **What is the `StampedLock` class in Java, and how does it differ from `ReentrantReadWriteLock`?**
   - Discuss the features and use cases of `StampedLock`.

5. **How does the `java.util.concurrent` package help in concurrent programming?**
   - Provide an overview of the main classes and interfaces in this package and their use cases.

These questions should give you a comprehensive understanding of concurrency in Java, covering basic concepts to advanced features and practical implementations.
