these three annotations are commonly confused because they‚Äôre all related to **mocking** in testing, but they come from slightly different contexts. Let‚Äôs break them down clearly:

---

## üîπ `@Mock` (Mockito)

* Comes from **Mockito** (`org.mockito.Mock`).
* Creates a **mock object** of a class/interface.
* Used in **unit tests** (pure Java, without Spring context).
* By itself, it won‚Äôt inject into anything ‚Äî just creates a mock.

Example:

```java
@Mock
private UserRepository userRepository;
```

‚û°Ô∏è Here, `userRepository` is a Mockito mock, not a real bean.

---

## üîπ `@InjectMocks` (Mockito)

* Comes from **Mockito** (`org.mockito.InjectMocks`).
* Creates an instance of the class under test and **injects the mocks** into it (via constructor, setter, or field).
* Useful for **unit testing** services with mocked dependencies.

Example:

```java
@Mock
private UserRepository userRepository;

@InjectMocks
private UserService userService;  // Mocks are injected here
```

‚û°Ô∏è `userService` is a real object, but its dependencies are mocks.

---

## üîπ `@MockBean` (Spring Boot Test)

* Comes from **Spring Boot Test** (`org.springframework.boot.test.mock.mockito.MockBean`).
* Replaces a **bean in the Spring application context** with a Mockito mock.
* Useful for **integration tests** where you load Spring context but want to mock out a dependency.
* Ensures that anywhere the bean is `@Autowired`, the mock is injected.

Example:

```java
@SpringBootTest
class UserServiceIntegrationTest {

    @MockBean
    private UserRepository userRepository;  // replaces real repo bean in context

    @Autowired
    private UserService userService; // gets mock-injected repo
}
```

‚û°Ô∏è This is Spring-aware; it works with the context, unlike plain `@Mock`.

## üîë Key Differences

| Annotation     | Library     | Scope                                                | Use Case                                       |
| -------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `@Mock`        | Mockito     | Creates mock only                                    | Unit tests without Spring                      |
| `@InjectMocks` | Mockito     | Injects mocks into class under test                  | Unit tests to test real class with mocked deps |
| `@MockBean`    | Spring Boot | Replaces Spring bean with mock in ApplicationContext | Integration tests with Spring context          |

---

‚úÖ **In short**:

* Use `@Mock` + `@InjectMocks` for **plain unit tests** (no Spring).
* Use `@MockBean` when doing **Spring Boot integration tests** where the bean exists in the context.

üëâ Do you want me to also show a **side-by-side example** where the same test is written with `@Mock/@InjectMocks` vs `@MockBean`, so you can see when to use which?
