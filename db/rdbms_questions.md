2. **What is a primary key, and why is it important?**
3. **What is a foreign key, and how does it enforce referential integrity?**
4. **Explain the difference between a primary key and a unique key.**
5. **What is a join? Explain the different types of joins available in SQL.**

### PostgreSQL Specific
6. **What is the difference between `VARCHAR` and `TEXT` in PostgreSQL?**
7. **How do you create a user and grant them permissions in PostgreSQL? Provide SQL commands.**

10. **Explain the concept of table inheritance in PostgreSQL.**

### Advanced Concepts
11. **What is a transaction in a database, and how is it used? Provide an example in PostgreSQL.**
12. **Explain the concept of isolation levels in a transaction. What isolation levels are supported by PostgreSQL?**
13. **What are materialized views, and how do they differ from regular views in PostgreSQL?**
14. **Describe the process of database normalization. What are the normal forms, and why are they important?**
