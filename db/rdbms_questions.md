### ACID Properties in a Database

The ACID properties are a set of principles that ensure reliable processing of database transactions. They stand for:

1. **Atomicity**:
   - **Definition**: Ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit. It either completes in its entirety or not at all.
   - **Example**: In a bank transfer, money must be deducted from one account and added to another. If one part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.

2. **Consistency**:
   - **Definition**: Ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, maintaining database invariants (rules).
   - **Example**: If a database rule states that account balances cannot be negative, any transaction violating this rule will be rolled back.

3. **Isolation**:
   - **Definition**: Ensures that concurrent transactions do not affect each other. Each transaction should appear to run in isolation from others.
   - **Example**: Two transactions modifying the same data do not interfere with each other and produce the same result as if they were run sequentially.

4. **Durability**:
   - **Definition**: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, its effects are permanently recorded in the database, even in case of a system failure.
   - **Example**: After a successful bank transfer, the changes to account balances are saved and will survive a crash or power failure.

### Primary Key

- **Definition**: A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identify a row in a table.
- **Importance**: 
  - **Uniqueness**: Ensures that each row can be uniquely identified.
  - **Indexing**: Automatically creates a unique index on the column(s), improving search performance.
  - **Data Integrity**: Prevents duplicate rows and ensures each row is easily accessible.

### Foreign Key

- **Definition**: A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that uniquely identifies rows in another table.
- **Referential Integrity**:
  - **Enforcement**: Ensures that the values in the foreign key column match values in the primary key column of the referenced table.
  - **Cascading Actions**: Supports actions like CASCADE, SET NULL, or RESTRICT on updates and deletions, ensuring that related data remains consistent.

### Difference Between Primary Key and Unique Key

- **Primary Key**:
  - **Uniqueness**: Ensures unique identification of each row.
  - **NULL Values**: Does not allow NULL values.
  - **Single per Table**: Only one primary key can be defined per table.

- **Unique Key**:
  - **Uniqueness**: Ensures that all values in the column(s) are unique.
  - **NULL Values**: Allows one or more NULL values (depending on the database system).
  - **Multiple per Table**: Multiple unique keys can be defined per table.

### Joins in SQL

Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. The different types of joins are:

1. **Inner Join**:
   - **Definition**: Returns rows when there is a match in both tables.
   - **Example**: `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.id = B.id;`

2. **Left (Outer) Join**:
   - **Definition**: Returns all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. If no match is found, NULLs are returned for columns from the right table.
   - **Example**: `SELECT * FROM A LEFT JOIN B ON A.id = B.id;`

3. **Right (Outer) Join**:
   - **Definition**: Returns all rows from the right table and the matched rows from the left table. If no match is found, NULLs are returned for columns from the left table.
   - **Example**: `SELECT * FROM A RIGHT JOIN B ON A.id = B.id;`

4. **Full (Outer) Join**:
   - **Definition**: Returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables. If there is no match, the result is NULL from the non-matching side.
   - **Example**: `SELECT * FROM A FULL OUTER JOIN B ON A.id = B.id;`

5. **Cross Join**:
   - **Definition**: Returns the Cartesian product of both tables, i.e., all possible combinations of rows.
   - **Example**: `SELECT * FROM A CROSS JOIN B;`

6. **Self Join**:
   - **Definition**: Joins a table to itself.
   - **Example**: `SELECT A.*, B.* FROM A INNER JOIN A B ON A.id = B.parent_id;`

### Example SQL Statements

**Inner Join**:
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.name 
FROM employees 
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

**Left Join**:
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.name 
FROM employees 
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

**Right Join**:
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.name 
FROM employees 
RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

**Full Outer Join**:
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.name 
FROM employees 
FULL OUTER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

**Cross Join**:
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.name 
FROM employees 
CROSS JOIN departments;
```

**Self Join**:
```sql
SELECT A.name, B.name 
FROM employees A 
INNER JOIN employees B ON A.manager_id = B.id;
```

#### Ans:
### Transaction in a Database

A transaction in a database is a sequence of one or more SQL operations treated as a single logical unit of work. Transactions ensure that database operations are executed reliably and adhere to the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

#### Example in PostgreSQL

Here's an example of how to use transactions in PostgreSQL:

```sql
BEGIN;

INSERT INTO accounts (id, balance) VALUES (1, 1000);
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 200 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 200 WHERE id = 2;

COMMIT;
```

If any of the SQL operations fail, you can roll back the transaction to its initial state:

```sql
BEGIN;

INSERT INTO accounts (id, balance) VALUES (1, 1000);
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 200 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 200 WHERE id = 2;

ROLLBACK;  -- Roll back all changes
```

### Isolation Levels in a Transaction

Isolation levels define the degree to which the operations in one transaction are isolated from those in other concurrent transactions. PostgreSQL supports the following isolation levels:

1. **Read Uncommitted**:
   - **Description**: Transactions can read data modified by other uncommitted transactions.
   - **Usage**: Not typically used as PostgreSQL does not implement this level.

2. **Read Committed** (Default in PostgreSQL):
   - **Description**: A transaction sees only data committed before it began. It does not see uncommitted data or changes committed by concurrent transactions after it started.
   - **Usage**: Suitable for most applications.

3. **Repeatable Read**:
   - **Description**: Ensures that if a transaction reads a row, it will see the same data for the duration of the transaction. It prevents non-repeatable reads but not phantom reads.
   - **Usage**: Useful when consistent reads are necessary within a transaction.

4. **Serializable**:
   - **Description**: The highest isolation level. Transactions are executed in such a way that they appear to be serialized. It prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.
   - **Usage**: Ensures complete isolation but can lead to reduced concurrency.

### Materialized Views vs. Regular Views in PostgreSQL

- **Regular Views**:
  - **Definition**: A virtual table representing the result of a query. It does not store data physically.
  - **Usage**: Provides a simplified interface for complex queries. Data is fetched from the underlying tables each time the view is queried.
  - **Example**:
    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW view_name AS
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;
    ```

- **Materialized Views**:
  - **Definition**: A view that stores the result of the query physically. It needs to be refreshed to reflect changes in the underlying tables.
  - **Usage**: Improves performance for expensive queries that do not need to be run in real-time.
  - **Example**:
    ```sql
    CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mat_view_name AS
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;

    -- To refresh the materialized view
    REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mat_view_name;
    ```

### Database Normalization

Database normalization is the process of organizing the fields and tables of a relational database to minimize redundancy and dependency. The main goal is to ensure data integrity and reduce data anomalies.

#### Normal Forms

1. **First Normal Form (1NF)**:
   - **Description**: Ensures that each column contains atomic (indivisible) values, and each value is stored in a separate cell.
   - **Example**: No repeating groups or arrays in columns.

2. **Second Normal Form (2NF)**:
   - **Description**: Achieves 1NF and ensures that all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
   - **Example**: Removes partial dependencies on the primary key.

3. **Third Normal Form (3NF)**:
   - **Description**: Achieves 2NF and ensures that all non-key attributes are not transitively dependent on the primary key.
   - **Example**: Removes transitive dependencies.

4. **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**:
   - **Description**: A stricter version of 3NF where every determinant is a candidate key.
   - **Example**: Ensures no redundancy based on functional dependencies.

5. **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**:
   - **Description**: Achieves BCNF and ensures no multi-valued dependencies.
   - **Example**: Eliminates independent multi-valued facts from the same table.

6. **Fifth Normal Form (5NF)**:
   - **Description**: Achieves 4NF and ensures no join dependencies.
   - **Example**: Ensures lossless join decomposition.

#### Importance

- **Data Integrity**: Ensures accurate and consistent data.
- **Reduced Redundancy**: Minimizes duplication of data.
- **Efficiency**: Improves query performance and storage efficiency.

### Concept of a Deadlock

A deadlock occurs when two or more transactions are waiting indefinitely for each other to release locks. This can halt the progress of all involved transactions.

#### Example

Transaction 1 locks row A and waits for row B, while Transaction 2 locks row B and waits for row A. Neither can proceed because they are waiting on each other.

#### Preventing Deadlocks

1. **Timeouts**: Set timeouts for transactions to avoid waiting indefinitely.
   ```sql
   SET statement_timeout = '2s';  -- Sets a 2-second timeout for statements
   ```

2. **Deadlock Detection**: PostgreSQL automatically detects deadlocks and aborts one of the transactions.
   ```sql
   SET deadlock_timeout = '1s';  -- Sets a 1-second deadlock detection interval
   ```

3. **Lock Ordering**: Ensure transactions acquire locks in a consistent order.
   ```sql
   BEGIN;

   -- Acquire locks in a consistent order
   LOCK TABLE table1 IN ACCESS EXCLUSIVE MODE;
   LOCK TABLE table2 IN ACCESS EXCLUSIVE MODE;

   COMMIT;
   ```

4. **Minimize Lock Scope**: Reduce the duration and scope of locks held by transactions.
   ```sql
   BEGIN;

   -- Perform operations that require locks
   UPDATE table1 SET column = value WHERE condition;
   
   COMMIT;
   ```

5. **Indexing**: Use appropriate indexing to minimize lock contention.
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);
   ```
