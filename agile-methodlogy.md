### 1. **Agile**

* **What it is**:
  A **mindset and set of values** (from the Agile Manifesto, 2001). It emphasizes:

  * Iterative and incremental development
  * Collaboration with customers
  * Flexibility to change
  * Delivering working software quickly
* **Not a process**: Agile itself isn’t a methodology — it’s the philosophy behind many frameworks (like Scrum, Kanban, XP, SAFe, LeSS, etc.).

---

### 2. **Scrum**

* **What it is**:
  A **framework within Agile** for managing work. It defines roles, events, and artifacts.
* **Key features**:

  * Timeboxed iterations (**Sprints**, usually 2–4 weeks)
  * Defined roles: **Product Owner**, **Scrum Master**, **Development Team**
  * Events: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective
  * Artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment
* **Strengths**: Provides structure and discipline for small, cross-functional teams.

### 3. **Kanban**

* **What it is**:
  A **visual workflow management method** (originating from lean manufacturing).
* **Key features**:

  * Visualize work on a **Kanban board** (columns like “To Do, In Progress, Done”)
  * Limit Work In Progress (WIP) to reduce bottlenecks
  * Continuous delivery (no fixed-length sprints)
* **Strengths**: Flexible, lightweight, good for flow-based work (like operations or maintenance).

---

### 4. **Other Agile Models**

* **XP (Extreme Programming)**: Focuses on engineering practices like test-driven development, pair programming, continuous integration.
* **SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)**: A comprehensive framework for scaling Agile across enterprises, with roles, ceremonies, and layers for portfolio/program/teams.
* **DSDM, Crystal, FDD**: Other methodologies emphasizing aspects like delivery speed, communication, or modeling.

These frameworks/models **implement Agile in different ways** depending on context (team vs. enterprise, product vs. services).

---

### 5. **LeSS (Large-Scale Scrum)**

* **What it is**:
  A **scaling framework** that extends Scrum principles to **multiple teams working on one product**.
* **Key features**:

  * Built on Scrum — not replacing it, just scaling it.
  * One **Product Backlog** and **one Product Owner** for the whole product.
  * Up to 8 teams (in “LeSS”), and even more in **LeSS Huge** (with additional structure).
  * Teams still run Sprints, Sprint Planning, Reviews, Retrospectives — but they’re coordinated at scale.
  * Focus on **simplicity**: "More with LeSS" — avoid extra roles, layers, and bureaucracy.

---

✅ **In short**:

* **Agile** = philosophy.
* **Scrum** = structured Agile framework (good for small teams).
* **Kanban** = visual, flow-based Agile method (continuous work).
* **Other models** = variations with different focuses (engineering, enterprise scaling, etc.).
* **LeSS** = a way to apply **Scrum at scale**, across multiple teams, while staying lightweight and avoiding the heavy overhead of frameworks like SAFe.
