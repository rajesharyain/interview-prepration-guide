Perfect 👍 — I’ll add **sample talking points/answer structures** for each category so you can practice. These aren’t “scripts,” but frameworks you can adapt to your own experiences.

---

## **1. Architecture & Design Principles**

**Q:** How do you approach designing a scalable and maintainable system?
**A (Talking Points):**

* Start with business requirements → understand constraints (users, data, SLAs).
* Apply design principles (SOLID, separation of concerns, modularity).
* Consider scalability (horizontal vs vertical), fault tolerance, and observability.
* Use patterns (e.g., CQRS, event-driven, caching layers).
* Keep documentation lightweight but clear.
* Example: “When designing our order management system, I separated read/write concerns with CQRS and added Redis caching, which reduced DB load by \~40%.”

---

**Q:** Monolith vs microservices – how do you decide?
**A:**

* Monolith: faster development, simple deployment, good for small teams/startups.
* Microservices: better scalability, independent deployments, but adds complexity (networking, monitoring, DevOps overhead).
* Decision factors: team maturity, domain complexity, expected scale.
* Example: “I recommended starting with a modular monolith in my last role, then refactoring to services as we scaled.”

---

**Q:** How do you ensure system resilience?
**A:**

* Circuit breakers (Hystrix-style patterns).
* Retries with backoff.
* Graceful degradation.
* Redundancy & failover.
* Monitoring/alerting.
* Example: “We added fallback flows in payments — if the primary provider failed, we switched to a backup, ensuring >99.9% uptime.”

---

## **2. Methodologies & Processes**

**Q:** How do you balance delivery speed with code quality?
**A:**

* Clear definition of “done” (code reviews, tests, CI/CD).
* Emphasize incremental delivery (small releases).
* Allocate time for refactoring/tech debt in each sprint.
* Example: “I enforced code reviews with a focus on readability and test coverage. Over time, this reduced bugs by \~30% while keeping delivery steady.”

---

**Q:** How do you handle technical debt?
**A:**

* Track it in the backlog.
* Categorize as high/medium/low impact.
* Align with business — show cost of not fixing (slower dev, risk of outages).
* Example: “I built a tech-debt register and reserved \~20% sprint capacity for cleanup. After 3 months, velocity increased by 15%.”

---

**Q:** Which methodology do you prefer — Scrum or Kanban?
**A:**

* Scrum: best for structured planning, clear increments, cross-functional teams.
* Kanban: best for continuous flow, ops-heavy teams.
* Adapt to context.
* Example: “My previous team moved from Scrum to Kanban because unplanned ops tickets were disrupting sprints. Productivity improved.”

---

## **3. Decision-Making & Trade-Offs**

**Q:** Build vs Buy decision — how do you evaluate?
**A:**

* Consider cost, time-to-market, maintenance overhead, customization needs.
* Example: “We needed authentication. Instead of building, we integrated Auth0 — faster, secure, and compliant. But for our analytics pipeline, we built in-house due to custom needs.”

---

**Q:** Tell me about a difficult architectural trade-off.
**A:**

* Situation → Options → Criteria → Decision → Outcome.
* Example: “For reporting, we debated batch vs real-time. Real-time was costly; batch was sufficient for daily insights. We chose batch, saving infra cost, while keeping design open for future real-time expansion.”

---

## **4. Team Leadership & Collaboration**

**Q:** How do you mentor engineers on architecture?
**A:**

* Pair design sessions, whiteboarding.
* Encourage design docs & peer reviews.
* Let juniors lead small design pieces with guidance.
* Example: “I introduced lightweight ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) so the team could practice articulating decisions.”

---

**Q:** How do you handle conflicts on architecture choices?
**A:**

* Encourage data-driven discussion (benchmarks, POCs).
* Facilitate alignment around business goals.
* Escalate only if blocked.
* Example: “When debating SQL vs NoSQL, I asked the team to prototype both. Data showed SQL was simpler for our needs. Everyone aligned quickly after.”

---

## **5. Scenario-Based Questions**

**Q:** You’re asked to migrate a monolith to microservices. How do you plan it?
**A:**

* Assess boundaries → identify modules with clear separations.
* Start with least risky (non-core) services.
* Add observability & CI/CD early.
* Communicate rollout plan to stakeholders.
* Example: “We began with user notifications as the first microservice, tested infra, then gradually extracted order processing.”

---

**Q:** System performance is degrading — what’s your approach?
**A:**

* Diagnose systematically: logs, APM, metrics.
* Narrow down (infra, DB, code, network).
* Short-term fix (caching, scaling), long-term fix (optimize queries, redesign).
* Example: “We had latency in search. Tracing showed DB bottleneck. Short-term, we added caching. Long-term, we built an index-based search service.”

👉 Pro tip: When answering, use the **STAR framework** (Situation, Task, Action, Result). That makes your answers clear, structured, and outcome-driven.

Would you like me to also draft a **“cheat sheet”** — like a one-pager you can glance at before interviews with condensed key phrases for each question?
