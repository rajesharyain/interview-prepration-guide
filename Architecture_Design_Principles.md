1. Architecture & Design Principles

How do you approach designing a scalable and maintainable system?

Can you walk me through the high-level architecture of a system you designed recently?

What trade-offs do you consider when choosing between monolithic and microservices architectures?

How do you ensure system resilience and fault tolerance?

How would you design a system to handle high concurrency and throughput?

What are the key considerations for designing APIs (REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC)?

How do you approach designing for observability (logging, monitoring, tracing)?

How do you ensure security and compliance in your architectural decisions?

2. Methodologies & Processes

What’s your experience with Agile, Scrum, or Kanban? Which do you prefer and why?

How do you ensure your team balances delivery speed with code quality?

How do you handle technical debt in an agile environment?

Can you give an example of when you introduced a new methodology or process that improved team productivity?

How do you facilitate sprint planning, retrospectives, and backlog refinement as a lead?

What’s your approach to estimation (story points vs time-based)?

How do you handle changing requirements or shifting priorities mid-sprint?

3. Decision-Making & Trade-Offs

Tell me about a time when you had to make a difficult architectural trade-off.

How do you evaluate when to build in-house vs buy/third-party solutions?

How do you balance short-term business goals with long-term technical health?

How do you handle disagreements among senior engineers about architecture decisions?

4. Team Leadership & Collaboration

How do you mentor engineers on architectural thinking?

How do you ensure all team members are aligned with the technical vision?

How do you communicate complex architectural decisions to non-technical stakeholders?

How do you balance hands-on coding vs leadership responsibilities as a team lead?

5. Scenario-Based Questions

If your system suddenly starts showing performance bottlenecks, how would you approach diagnosing and resolving it?

You join a team with a large monolithic codebase. Management wants to migrate to microservices. How would you plan and execute this transition?

Your team has conflicting views on using Kubernetes vs serverless. How do you facilitate a decision?

A release is due in two weeks, but QA finds major bugs. How do you balance deadlines vs quality?
