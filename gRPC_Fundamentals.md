Title: gRPC Fundamentals: Building Efficient APIs with Java
Subtitle: Learn how to design, implement, and deploy high-performance microservices with Google‚Äôs Remote Procedure Call framework using Java.

üß≠ Course Description

In this beginner-friendly course, you‚Äôll learn how to build modern, efficient, and scalable APIs using gRPC ‚Äî Google‚Äôs high-performance, open-source RPC framework. Designed for developers familiar with Java, this course walks you through everything from the fundamentals of gRPC architecture to building your first client-server application and optimizing communication in microservice environments.

Through clear explanations and hands-on examples, you‚Äôll explore protocol buffers, service definitions, client-server streaming, and interceptors ‚Äî all within the Java ecosystem. By the end, you‚Äôll be confident in creating your own gRPC services and integrating them into distributed systems.

This course is ideal for backend developers, Java programmers, and software engineers looking to modernize their API skills and understand how gRPC compares to REST in real-world use cases.

üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, learners will be able to:

Explain the core concepts and architecture of gRPC.

Install and configure gRPC with Java in a local development environment.

Define services and messages using Protocol Buffers (.proto).

Implement a basic gRPC client and server in Java.

Utilize streaming and error-handling in gRPC communication.

Apply best practices for authentication, security, and performance optimization in gRPC-based systems.

Module 1, Lesson 1.1: What is gRPC and Why It Matters

‚ÄúWelcome to this lesson on gRPC! Before we dive into code, let‚Äôs understand what makes gRPC special. gRPC, developed by Google, is a high-performance, open-source framework that lets you define how services communicate with each other using simple contracts defined in .proto files.

Unlike REST, which typically uses JSON over HTTP, gRPC uses HTTP/2 for transport and Protocol Buffers for serialization. This gives us faster, smaller, and more reliable communication‚Äîperfect for modern microservice architectures.‚Äù

Module 3, Lesson 3.2: Implementing the gRPC Client in Java

‚ÄúNow that our server is ready, let‚Äôs build a client to talk to it. In gRPC, the client stub acts as a local representation of the server‚Äîso calling a remote method feels like calling a local function. We‚Äôll create a channel, use the stub generated from our .proto file, and send a request to the server. You‚Äôll see how simple and elegant this process is compared to REST calls.‚Äù

üß© Practical Exercises / Projects

Exercise 1: Build Your First gRPC Service

Create a simple calculator or greeting service using gRPC and Java.

Define a .proto file, generate code, and implement both client and server.

Exercise 2: Add Streaming Support

Extend your application to include server-side or bidirectional streaming.

Example: A live chat or data feed simulation.

Capstone Project: Build a Microservice with gRPC and Deploy It

Design a small microservice (e.g., ‚ÄúUser Profile Service‚Äù) using gRPC.

Implement authentication and error-handling.

Deploy your service in a Docker container or cloud environment.
